1. Difference between Function Declarations and Function Expressions:
Function Declaration:
Declared using the function keyword followed by the function name.
Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are declared.
javascript
Copy code
function greet() {
    return "Hello!";
}
Function Expression:
Assigning a function to a variable or passing it as an argument to another function.
Function expressions are not hoisted.
javascript
Copy code
const greet = function() {
    return "Hello!";
};


2. Arrow Functions and Their Differences from Traditional Functions:
Arrow Functions:
Introduced in ES6, providing a more concise syntax for writing functions.
Arrow functions do not have their own this keyword; they inherit this from the enclosing lexical context.
They have implicit return for single expressions without curly braces.
javascript
Copy code
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
Differences:
Arrow functions have a different behavior with this compared to traditional functions.
They do not have their own arguments object; instead, they use the arguments of the enclosing lexical context.
Arrow functions cannot be used as constructor functions to create new objects.


3. Handling Asynchronous Operations in JavaScript:
Asynchronous operations in JavaScript are typically handled using callbacks, promises, or async/await.
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed once the asynchronous operation is complete.
Promises provide a cleaner syntax for handling asynchronous operations and allow chaining multiple asynchronous tasks together.
Async/await is syntactic sugar built on top of promises, providing a more synchronous-like syntax for handling asynchronous operations.

4. Purpose of a Callback Function and How to Use It:
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of action.
Callback functions are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations, event handling, and to implement higher-order functions.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = "Some data";
        callback(data);
    }, 1000);
}

fetchData(data => {
    console.log(data);
});

5. Lexical Scoping and Its Relation to the this Keyword:
Lexical scoping refers to the scope resolution based on the physical location of the code in the source code.
In JavaScript, functions create their own scope, and they have access to variables defined in their parent scope.
Arrow functions in JavaScript have lexical this, meaning they inherit this from the surrounding code where they are defined.
I'll continue with the next set of questions in the following response.

Continuing from where we left off:


6. Creation and Usage of Closures in JavaScript:
Creation:
A closure is created when an inner function has access to its outer function's variables, even after the outer function has returned.
This is possible because the inner function maintains a reference to its outer function's variables (lexical environment).
Usage:
Closures are commonly used to encapsulate private data within functions, create function factories, and implement partial application and currying.
They allow for maintaining state across multiple function calls without polluting the global scope.
javascript
Copy code
function counter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
        return ++count;
    };
}

const increment = counter();
console.log(increment()); // Output: 1
console.log(increment()); // Output: 2


7. Difference Between undefined and null in JavaScript:
undefined:
Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
It's also the default return value for functions with no explicit return value.
null:
Represents the intentional absence of any value or a variable that has been explicitly set to have no value.
It's typically used to explicitly indicate that a variable is empty or has no value.

8. Hoisting in JavaScript and Its Effects on Function and Variable Declarations:
Hoisting:
Refers to JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
Only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
Function Declarations:
Entire function declarations are hoisted, so they can be called before they are declared.
javascript
Copy code
greet(); // Works even though greet() is called before its declaration

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
Variable Declarations:
Variable declarations using var are hoisted but initialized with undefined.
Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted, but they are not initialized until their actual declaration is reached.
javascript
Copy code
console.log(name); // Output: undefined
var name = "John";
