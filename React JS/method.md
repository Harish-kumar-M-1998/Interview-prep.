1. GET:
Purpose: Used to request data from a specified resource.
Safe: The operation should not have side effects on the server.
Idempotent: Making the same request multiple times should produce the same result.
Example: Retrieving a user's profile information, fetching a list of products from a database.
2. POST:
Purpose: Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
Not Safe: The operation may have side effects on the server (e.g., modifying data).
Not Idempotent: Making the same request multiple times may result in different outcomes (e.g., creating multiple resources).
Example: Submitting a form, creating a new user account, uploading a file.
3. PUT:
Purpose: Used to update data on a specified resource.
Idempotent: Making the same request multiple times should produce the same result.
Example: Updating a user's profile information, replacing the contents of a file on a server.
4. DELETE:
Purpose: Used to delete a specified resource.
Idempotent: Making the same request multiple times should produce the same result (i.e., the resource is deleted).
Example: Deleting a user account, removing an item from a shopping cart.
These HTTP methods provide a standardized way for clients (e.g., web browsers, mobile apps) to interact with web servers. They allow for different types of operations to be performed on resources hosted on the server. By adhering to the principles of each method, developers can ensure predictable and consistent behavior in their web applications.
